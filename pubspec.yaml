# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+BUILD_NUMBER
#
# VERSION NAMING (what users see):
#   - MAJOR: Breaking changes or complete redesign (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
#   - MINOR: New features, backward compatible (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
#   - PATCH: Bug fixes only (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
#
# BUILD NUMBER (internal tracking):
#   - MUST always increase with each build (+1, +2, +3, etc.)
#   - Used by app stores to determine which build is newer
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   version: 1.0.0+1  # Initial release
#   version: 1.0.0+2  # Internal test build (same version, new build)
#   version: 1.0.1+3  # Bug fix release
#   version: 1.1.0+4  # New feature release
#   version: 2.0.0+5  # Major redesign
#
# BEST PRACTICES:
#   - For testing: Just increment build number (1.0.0+2, 1.0.0+3)
#   - For production: Update version name AND build number (1.0.1+4)
#   - Always increment build number for EVERY build, even if version stays same
#
version: 1.0.2+2

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package

# Add this entire section to the end of pubspec.yaml
flutter_launcher_icons:
  # Provide the relative path to your icon file (PNG is recommended)
  image_path: "assets/images/play_store_512.png"

  # Set to true to generate icons for both Android and iOS
  android: true
  ios: true

  # Optional: For Android only, use an adaptive icon set
  # (recommended for Android 8.0+ devices)
  adaptive_icon_background: "#FFFFFF" # Use a solid color hex code for the background
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/images/play_store_512.png" # Optional: A different path for the foreground layer (e.g., your logo cutout)
